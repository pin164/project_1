# Project 1: Hotel bookings Analysis
## Analytics Project Proposal: Understanding Hotel Booking Patterns

**1. Introduction:**
   In today's hospitality industry, understanding customer behavior and booking patterns is crucial for effective business management. This proposal outlines an analytics project aimed at analyzing hotel booking data for both a city hotel and a resort hotel to gain insights into customer preferences, seasonal trends, and factors influencing booking decisions.

**2. Objectives:**
   - Analyze customer room preference.
   - Analyze seasonal variations in booking patterns.
   - Understand the differences in booking behaviors between city and resort hotels.
   - Provide actionable insights to optimize pricing, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

**3. Research questions:**

 a) **What are the primary factors influencing hotel booking decisions?**
   - This question aims to identify the most influential factors such as pricing, location, amenities, and customer reviews.

 b) **How do booking patterns vary across different seasons and holidays?**
   - Understanding seasonal variations in booking trends can help hotels optimize pricing and marketing strategies accordingly.

 c) **What are the demographic characteristics of customers who book city hotels versus resort hotels?**
   - Exploring the demographic differences between customers of city and resort hotels can provide insights into target markets and preferences.

 d) **How do booking channels (e.g., direct bookings, online travel agencies) impact booking behavior and preferences?**
   - Analyzing the influence of different booking channels can help hotels allocate resources effectively and optimize distribution strategies.

 e) **What is the relationship between lead time (time between booking and check-in) and booking cancellations?**
   - Understanding the relationship between lead time and cancellation rates can help hotels manage inventory and revenue forecasting.

 f) **Are there specific room types or amenities that are more popular among different customer segments?**
   - Identifying preferences for room types and amenities can inform hotel management decisions regarding room allocation and service offerings.

**4. Dataset Description:**
   The dataset consists of historical hotel booking records for both a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes information such as booking dates, lead times, length of stay, booking channels, room types, customer demographics, and cancellation status.

**5. Methodology:**
   - **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations for analysis.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, correlations, and patterns in the data. Explore the relationships between different features and booking outcomes.
   - **Seasonal Analysis:** Analyze booking trends across different seasons, holidays, and special events to identify peak booking periods and seasonal variations.
   - **Segmentation Analysis:** Segment customers based on demographics, booking behavior, and preferences. Analyze each segment's characteristics and booking patterns.
   - **Visualization and Reporting:** Visualize key findings using charts, graphs, and dashboards. Summarize insights and recommendations in a comprehensive report.

**6. Expected Outcomes:**
   - Identification of key factors driving hotel bookings, such as pricing, seasonality, and customer demographics.
   - Insights into differences in booking behaviors between city and resort hotels.
   - Actionable recommendations for pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation to optimize hotel revenue and occupancy rates.

**7. Team and Resources:**
   - Data Analyst: Responsible for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
   - Domain Expert: Provides industry knowledge and insights to guide analysis.
   - Project Manager: Oversees project execution, timeline adherence, and resource allocation.
   - Software and Tools: Utilize programming languages such as Python or R for analysis, along with data visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn) and machine learning frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn).

**8. Conclusion:**
   This analytics project aims to leverage historical hotel booking data to gain actionable insights into customer behavior and booking patterns. By understanding the factors influencing hotel bookings, businesses can optimize their strategies to improve revenue generation and customer satisfaction.
