**2. Objectives:**
   - Analyze customer room preference.
   - Analyze seasonal variations in booking patterns.
   - Understand the differences in booking behaviors between city and resort hotels.
   - Provide actionable insights to optimize pricing, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

**3. Dataset Description:**
   The dataset consists of historical hotel booking records for both a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes information such as booking dates, lead times, length of stay, booking channels, room types, customer demographics, and cancellation status.

**4. Methodology:**
   - **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations for analysis.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, correlations, and patterns in the data. Explore the relationships between different features and booking outcomes.
   - **Seasonal Analysis:** Analyze booking trends across different seasons, holidays, and special events to identify peak booking periods and seasonal variations.
   - **Segmentation Analysis:** Segment customers based on demographics, booking behavior, and preferences. Analyze each segment's characteristics and booking patterns.
   - **Visualization and Reporting:** Visualize key findings using charts, graphs, and dashboards. Summarize insights and recommendations in a comprehensive report.

**5. Expected Outcomes:**
   - Identification of key factors driving hotel bookings, such as pricing, seasonality, and customer demographics.
   - Insights into differences in booking behaviors between city and resort hotels.
   - Actionable recommendations for pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation to optimize hotel revenue and occupancy rates.

**6. Timeline:**
   - Data Collection and Preprocessing: 2 weeks
   - Exploratory Data Analysis: 3 weeks
   - Seasonal Analysis: 2 weeks
   - Segmentation Analysis: 2 weeks
   - Predictive Modeling: 4 weeks
   - Visualization and Reporting: 2 weeks

**7. Team and Resources:**
